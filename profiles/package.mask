# Masked for testing - those ebuilds contain qt-copy patches
# for 4.4.2 series.
# qt-gui so far works very fine and solves reproducible crashes
# with plasmoids (I even managed to reproduce them on Ubuntu)
# qt-core contains some *unsafe* patches that cause
# kbuilsycoca4 to crash and need to be sorted out - I commented them
# out for now.
